# Autogenerate Django Models

Learn how to take a scraped dataset and turn it into Django models using inspectdb. You can also use this method for legacy databases.

We'll use:
- Django (v2.2+)
- Jupyter
- SQLAlchemy
- Pandas
- sqlite3
- Python (v3+)

You can use this method to convert `SQLAlchemy`-managed models into `Django`-managed models as well.
